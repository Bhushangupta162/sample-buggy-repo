# Sample Buggy Repository

This repository contains a few intentional issues:
- **calculate_average** may lead to a division by zero.
- **buggy_function** has a syntax error.
- **inefficient_loop** is intentionally inefficient.

Use this repository to test AutoBugHunter and verify that it detects these issues.
